# Sponsor Finder v2.5: Director Search & Intelligence Upgrade

This update drastically speeds up the process of finding, verifying, and saving the *right* decision-maker for your target companies.

## 1. The "OpenCorporates" Bridge
Finding the actual owner or director of a company is often the hardest part of sponsorship acquisition. We have added a direct bridge to the world's largest open database of companies.

### How to use it:
1. Go to **Outreach Assistant** -> **Stage 1: Connect**.
2. Expand the **"0️⃣ Corporate Registry"** section.
3. Click the **"Search on OpenCorporates"** link. This opens a new tab searching specifically for your target company.
4. On the OpenCorporates page, identifying the active **Directors**.
5. **Copy** their names and **Paste** them into the "Director Names" box in the app.

### The Benefit:
> **Zero Guesswork.** You utilize official government data to find the legal directors, avoiding generic "Marketing Manager" searches that often lead to gatekeepers.

## 2. "Smart" Social Intelligence Tools
Once you paste names into the box, the app instantly builds a custom research dashboard for those specific people.

### What it does:
*   **Name Cleaning:** If you paste "Barbara Anne O'CONNOR", the app smart-cleans it to "Barbara O'CONNOR" for better search results.
*   **LinkedIn X-Ray:** Generates a one-click button to search Google for `site:linkedin.com "Barbara O'CONNOR" "Target Company"`.
*   **Facebook Location Search:** Generates a one-click button to search Facebook for `Barbara O'CONNOR` + `[City extracted from Address]`.

### The Benefit:
> **10x Faster Research.** You no longer need to manually type complex Boolean search strings into Google. The app constructs the perfect query to find *that specific person* on LinkedIn and Facebook in seconds.

## 3. One-Click "Set Primary"
You found the right person. Now you need to make sure your emails address them.

### How to use it:
*   Next to every Director you find, there is now a **"Set Primary"** button.
*   Click it once. You will see a "✅ Primary" badge appear.

### The Benefit:
> **Instant Sync.** This immediately saves the clean name (e.g., "Barbara O'CONNOR") to your database (Airtable/Sheets/Local).
>
> All your **Message Templates** (Email, LinkedIn, Scripts) instantly update to say **"Hi Barbara,"** instead of "Hi [Contact Name],".

## 4. Simplified Web Deep Dive
We removed the clutter and focused on the signals that actually help you write a sponsorship pitch.

### The New Workflow:
Instead of 10+ confusing links, you now have **6 High-Impact Signals**:
1.  **Google Search (General)**: Quick sanity check.
2.  **News & Expansion**: Looks specifically for "new site", "opening", or "expansion" (Great reasons to pitch!).
3.  **Sponsorship Check**: Checks if they have sponsored anyone before.
4.  **High Impact Headlines**: Checks for "merger", "launch", or "lawsuit".
5.  **Latest News**: Filters for news only from **2025 onwards**.
6.  **External Press Only**: Removes the company's own website from results to see what *others* say about them.

### The Benefit:
> **Actionable Intel.** You stop wasting time reading generic "About Us" pages and start finding the *triggers* (expansions, product launches) that make a company want to sponsor you.
